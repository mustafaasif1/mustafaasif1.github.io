They are the backbone of modern life, used by over 68% of the global population for everything from banking to education. But as we generate trillions of bytes of data daily, we are also creating a massive "attack surface". In recent years, we\u2019ve seen how single vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic results, such as the Equifax breach affecting 147 million people or the British Airways data breach that led to a \xa3183 million fine.\n\nFor my Master\'s thesis at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I wanted to move away from rigid, "one-size-fits-all" security tools. I developed a collaborative multi-agent framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect vulnerabilities not by just reading code, but by "debating" it.\n\n## The Problem: Why Traditional Security is Often "Noisy" or "Blind"\n\nCurrently, most developers rely on two main methods, but both have significant flaws:\n\n1. **Static Analysis**  \n   This scans code without running it. While fast, it is famous for high false positive rates, often flagging code that isn\'t actually dangerous and causing "alert fatigue" for developers.\n\n2. **Dynamic Analysis**  \n   This involves executing code with test cases. It is more accurate but can be prohibitively expensive and complex to set up for large, modern codebases.\n\nEven when we try to use a single "smart" AI like GPT-4, we run into the hallucination problem where the AI confidently claims a vulnerability exists when it doesn\'t, or misses subtle logic because it lacks a deep "reasoning" process.\n\n## The Solution: A Layered "War Room" of Specialized Agents\n\nMy research suggests that the answer isn\'t one "genius" AI, but a modular, layered architecture where different agents play specific roles, much like a human security audit team.\n\n### Layer 1: The Hyper-Paranoid Scout (Pattern Matching)\n\nThe process begins with the Pattern Matching Agent. Unlike traditional tools that try to be perfectly accurate, this agent is prompted to be ultra-vigilant and "hyper-paranoid". Using a hybrid approach that combines LLM reasoning with tools like Semgrep, it flags anything even the slightest hint of a weakness across 11 critical categories including SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Path Traversal.\n\n### Layer 2: The Reasoning Loop (The "Debate")\n\nOnce a potential flaw is flagged, a specialized team of three agents enters a recursive loop to validate the claim:\n\n- **The Generator**  \n  This agent acts as a "white-hat hacker". It must absolutely confirm a vulnerability exists before crafting a realistic test case and explaining the technical "attack chain".\n\n- **The Simulator**  \n  This is a "virtual runtime environment". It doesn\'t actually run the code (saving on cost), but it faithfully models the behaviour described by the Generator\u2019s test case to see if it causes a security violation.\n\n- **The Evaluator**  \n  Acting as a senior security auditor, the Evaluator is brutally honest. It critiques the Generator\'s logic and simulation results. If the evidence is weak or speculative, it sends the Generator back to the drawing board.\n\n### Layer 3: The Supreme Court (Judgment & Aggregation)\n\nFinally, a Judge Agent reviews the entire conversation history. It doesn\'t just look at the final answer, but it reviews the "debate" between the Generator and Evaluator to make an evidence-based final verdict: **Vulnerable**, **Potentially Vulnerable**, or **Not Vulnerable**.\n\n<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4">\n  <img src="/assets/images/articles/multi-agent-thesis/multi_agent_framework.png" alt="Multi-agent architecture and data flow" />\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## The Verdict: Does the "A-Team" Approach Actually Work?\n\nThe empirical results were eye-opening. By comparing a "single-agent" baseline to this multi-agent framework, we saw massive improvements:\n\n- **Reliability Boost**  \n  For models like GPT-4.1-Mini, the recall (the ability to find actual flaws) jumped from 0.35 to a staggering 0.85.\n\n- **Hallucination Control**  \n  The inter-agent critique was incredibly effective at filtering out false alarms. In GPT-4, the system correctly removed 191 false positives that would have otherwise bothered a developer.\n\n- **Arbitration Accuracy**  \n  In the 4.4% of cases where the agents disagreed, the Judge was able to resolve the conflict and align with the "ground truth" 75.47% of the time.\n\n## Looking Ahead: The Future of Autonomous Security\n\nThis research proves that the future of software security isn\'t just about "bigger" AI models, but about smarter collaboration. By forcing AI agents to cross-examine each other, we can create systems that are not only more accurate but also more transparent and explainable.\n\nAs we move forward, the next step is to integrate dynamic execution agents which are actual sandboxed runners that can "prove" a vulnerability by executing it in a safe environment.\n\n---\n\n*This research was conducted as part of my Master\'s thesis at the Technical University of Munich, completed in August 2025.

Through user research, we found that only 9.2% of people donate clothes to charitable organizations, primarily due to limited awareness and access. Most individuals either throw clothes away or give them directly to acquaintances.\n\n> #### KapraEid bridges this gap by developing a platform that provides efficient communication between organizations and donors, helping boost people\'s confidence in these organizations.\n\n## Brainstorming Phase\nWe conducted brainstorming sessions over Zoom and Mural to define requirements and key features for the application.\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on user research with donors and organizations, we identified core requirements:  \n\n- **User-friendly interface** that makes the donation process convenient for a wide variety of audiences\n- **Tutorial/demo** to guide users through the donation process\n- **Minimal questions** during donation (only essential details like photos, descriptions, and categories)\n- **Quick process** that respects donors\' limited time\n- **Transparency and trust-building** through feedback, reviews, and clear communication channels\n- **Organization visibility** so donors can learn about different organizations and their initiatives\n\n### Key Features\n\nWe identified the following essential features:  \n\n- ***Donation drives with progress tracking:*** Organizations create targeted drives with descriptions and deadlines. Donors see active drives on their home screen with real-time progress indicators (items collected vs. target, donor count) and can view detailed drive pages before contributing.\n\n- ***Organization discovery:*** A searchable organizations section displays organization cards with ratings, allowing donors to browse and filter to find causes that align with their values. Each organization can showcase their mission and impact.\n\n- ***Transparent donation history:*** Donors can track all their contributions through a tabbed interface (Pending, Approved, Successful) showing item counts, pickup schedules, payment methods, and images of donated items for full transparency.\n\n- ***Organization dashboard:*** Organizations have access to comprehensive statistics including all-time and monthly donation counts, ratings, reviews, and request management (pending vs. accepted), all visible on the home screen.\n\n- ***Success stories:*** Both donors and organizations can view and share success stories showcasing the real-world impact of donations, building trust and motivation.\n\n- ***Streamlined donation flow:*** A prominent floating action button provides quick access to donation, minimizing steps and respecting donors\' limited time.\n\n- ***Messaging & communication:*** Direct messaging channels enable donors and organizations to communicate about queries, pickup coordination, and support.\n\nAfter identifying these features, we prioritized them by feasibility and importance to reach our final design.\n\n## Design Phase\nThe design phase consisted of Lo-fi and Hi-fi prototypes, incorporating solutions to problems identified during user research.\n\n### Lo-fi Design\n\nWe built our prototype on Balsamiq for Android (356x700 dimensions), focusing on creating separate but complementary experiences for donors and organizations.\n\n**Donor prototype:** The home screen was organized into clear sections: donation drives at the top showing progress metrics, followed by a searchable organizations section with rating displays, and success stories at the bottom. We designed a dedicated donation drive detail page with comprehensive information and a clear call-to-action button. The donations history page used a tabbed interface (Pending, Approved, Successful) to help users track their contributions. A prominent floating action button in the navigation bar provided quick access to the donation flow.\n\n**Organization prototype:** The organizational interface prioritized a statistics dashboard on the home screen, giving representatives immediate visibility into their performance metrics. We simplified content creation with direct access to posting stories and managing donation drives from the main screen, ensuring a low learning curve so organizations could focus on their core mission.\n\n### Hi-fi Design\nAfter testing the lo-fi prototype, we refined the interface based on user feedback. The final design features a clean, intuitive interface with distinct experiences for donors and organizations.\n\n**Donor Interface:**\nThe donor homepage prominently displays active donation drives with real-time progress indicators (e.g., "121 clothes out of 400 collected") and donor counts. Below this, a searchable organizations section allows donors to browse and filter organizations by name, with each card showing ratings to help build trust. Success stories are featured to showcase the impact of donations. The navigation bar includes a prominent yellow "+ DONATE NOW" button for quick access to the donation flow.\n\nThe donation drive detail page provides comprehensive information including the organizing foundation, drive timeline, current progress, and a detailed description of the cause. A prominent "SUPPORT THIS CAUSE" button guides users to contribute.\n\nThe donations history page organizes contributions into three tabs: Pending, Approved, and Successful. Each successful donation card displays organization name, donation timestamp, item count, pickup date and time, payment method, and a "VIEW IMAGE" button for transparency.\n\n**Organization Interface:**\nThe organizational homepage features a statistics dashboard showing key metrics: all-time donations, monthly donations, current rating, total reviews, pending requests, and accepted requests. This gives organizations immediate insight into their performance. Success stories can be posted and managed directly from the home screen, and the navigation includes a "+ UPLOAD POST" button for easy content creation.\n\nThroughout both interfaces, we maintained a clean white background with blue accents and yellow for primary actions, ensuring visual consistency and reducing cognitive load.\n'}]}}]);
